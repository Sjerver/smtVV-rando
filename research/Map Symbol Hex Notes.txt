Start of each entry is 0x17000000000000003100000000000000
Demon ID is 25 bytes later, call this 0x00
0x1d is float movement speed
0x74 is float scale factor

Could probably replace demons that no longer spawn on the overworld with their replacements
to have less demons using the default slow speed

Json specific notes:
Each table entry must have a unique name or all entries but the final one using the same name will be overwritten. The unique name must also be added to the NameMap
